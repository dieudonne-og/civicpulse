## Task Dependencies

Some tasks have dependencies and should be completed in a specific order:

1. Project Setup tasks should be completed first
2. Database Implementation should be done before other feature implementations
3. Authentication System should be implemented before Complaint Submission
4. Agency Routing requires both Database and Complaint Management to be completed
5. User Interfaces can be developed in parallel with other features
6. Testing should be conducted throughout development but formal tests after features are complete
7. Deployment is the final phase

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Project Setup (all tasks)
- Database Implementation (DB-01 to DB-05)
- Authentication System (AUTH-01, AUTH-02, AUTH-05)

### Phase 2: Core Functionality

- Complaint Management (MGT-01, MGT-03, MGT-04)
- Agency Routing (ROUTE-01, ROUTE-02)
- Basic User Interfaces (UI-01, UI-02, UI-03)

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
- Remaining Authentication tasks
- Remaining Submission tasks
- Remaining Management tasks
- Remaining Routing tasks
- Enhanced User Interfaces

### Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
- All Testing tasks
- All Deployment tasks

## Task Assignment Guidelines

When assigning tasks:
1. Consider task dependencies and ensure prerequisites are completed
2. Assign related tasks to the same developer for consistency
3. Balance workload across the development team
4. Prioritize high-priority tasks within each phase
5. Update task status in this document as work progresses

## Branching Strategy

Following the project's contribution guidelines:
1. Create a new branch for each task using the specified branch name format
2. Branch from `develop` for all feature work
3. Follow the commit message conventions in the CONTRIBUTING.md document
4. Submit a Pull Request when the task is complete
5. Request review from at least one team member

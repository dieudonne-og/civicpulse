# Security Policy

## Overview

The security of the Citizen Complaints and Engagement System is a top priority. This document outlines security considerations, best practices, and procedures for reporting vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within the Citizen Complaints and Engagement System, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until it has been addressed by the development team.
2. Send details of the vulnerability to the project maintainer or open a confidential issue.
3. Include as much information as possible about the vulnerability:
   - Type of issue
   - Full paths of affected files
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the issue

## Data Retention & Protection

### Data Retention Policy
- Active complaints: Retain for 1 year after resolution
- Resolved complaints: Retain for 3 years after resolution
- User accounts: Retain while active + 1 year after last login
- Audit logs: Retain for 5 years
- Backups: Retain for 30 days

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest using AES-256
- Implement field-level encryption for PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
- Regular security audits (quarterly)
- Automated vulnerability scanning (weekly)
- Third-party security assessments (annually)

## Security Best Practices for Development

Developers working on this project should adhere to the following security practices:

### Authentication & Authorization

1. **Password Storage**
   - Never store passwords in plain text
   - Use PHP's `password_hash()` and `password_verify()` functions
   - Implement proper salt generation
   - Consider using Argon2id as the hashing algorithm

2. **Session Management**
   - Regenerate session IDs after login
   - Set secure and HttpOnly flags for cookies
   - Implement proper session timeout
   - Use CSRF tokens for all forms

3. **Access Control**
   - Implement proper role-based access control
   - Validate user permissions on the server side
   - Avoid hard-coded credentials

### Data Protection

1. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   - Use prepared statements for all database queries
   - Validate and sanitize all user inputs
   - Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing SQL errors

2. **XSS Prevention**
   - Sanitize all user inputs using `htmlspecialchars()` or similar functions
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - Use output encoding appropriate to the context (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc.)

3. **File Upload Security**
   - Validate file types, sizes, and content
   - Store uploaded files outside the web root if possible
   - Generate random filenames to prevent directory traversal attacks
   - Implement proper permissions on upload directories

### Configuration & Infrastructure

1. **Server Configuration**
   - Keep PHP, MySQL, and all dependencies up to date
   - Disable unnecessary PHP functions and modules
   - Configure proper error handling (no exposing of errors in production)
   - Set appropriate file permissions

2. **HTTPS Implementation**
   - Force HTTPS for all connections
   - Implement proper SSL/TLS configuration
   - Consider implementing HSTS
   - Maintain valid certificates

3. **Production Environment**
   - Remove development tools and debugging information
   - Configure appropriate security headers
   - Implement rate limiting for authentication attempts
   - Regularly back up the database

## Code Review Security Checklist

When reviewing code, use this security checklist:

- [ ] Authentication mechanisms are secure
- [ ] Authorization checks are in place for all sensitive operations
- [ ] User input is properly validated and sanitized
- [ ] SQL queries use prepared statements
- [ ] File operations are secure
- [ ] Sensitive data is properly protected
- [ ] Error handling does not expose sensitive information
- [ ] CSRF protections are implemented
- [ ] Security headers are properly configured
- [ ] Business logic does not contain security flaws

## Monitoring & Incident Response

### Logging
- Log all authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Log sensitive operations (e.g., data exports, user deletions)
- Store logs in a secure, centralized location
- Implement log rotation (30 days retention)

### Incident Response
1. **Identification**: Detect and confirm security incidents
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
3. Eradication: Remove threat and close vulnerabilities
4. Recovery: Restore systems from clean backups
5. Lessons Learned: Document and improve processes

## Security-Related PHP Configuration

Recommended PHP configuration settings for production:

```ini
# Disable display of errors in production
display_errors = Off
display_startup_errors = Off
log_errors = On
error_log = /path/to/error.log

# Limit file uploads
file_uploads = On
upload_max_filesize = 10M
max_file_uploads = 5

# Control allowed file types (adjust based on your needs)
upload_allowed_types = jpg,jpeg,png,gif,pdf,doc,docx

# Cookie security
session.cookie_httponly = 1
session.cookie_secure = 1
session.use_only_cookies = 1
session.cookie_samesite = "Strict"

# Session security
session.use_strict_mode = 1
session.gc_maxlifetime = 1800

# Disable potentially dangerous functions
disable_functions = exec,passthru,shell_exec,system,proc_open,popen,curl_exec,curl_multi_exec,parse_ini_file,show_source
```

## Database Security

Follow these database security practices:

1. Use a unique, strong password for the database user
2. Limit database user privileges based on requirements
3. Use separate database accounts for different environments (development, testing, production)
4. Regularly back up the database
5. Encrypt sensitive data stored in the database

Example user creation with limited privileges:

```sql
CREATE USER 'complaints_app'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'strong_password';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON citizen_complaints_db.* TO 'complaints_app'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

## API Security

### Rate Limiting
- Public endpoints: 100 requests/minute per IP
- Authenticated endpoints: 1,000 requests/minute per user
- Include rate limit headers in responses:
  - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Total allowed requests
  - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests
  - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when limit resets

### Authentication
- Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for API authentication
- Set appropriate token expiration (recommended: 15 minutes for access tokens)
- Implement refresh token rotation
- Invalidate tokens on logout

## Client-Side Security

Implement these client-side security practices:

1. Implement proper Content Security Policy
2. Use Subresource Integrity for third-party scripts
3. Implement proper input validation on the client side (in addition to server-side validation)
4. Avoid storing sensitive information in localStorage or sessionStorage
5. Sanitize data before rendering it to the DOM

2. Submit a proof-of-concept or exploit code if possible
3. Allow a reasonable time for remediation before public disclosure
4. Respect the privacy of our users and their data

## Security Update Process

1. **Assessment**: Security vulnerabilities will be assessed within 48 hours of reporting
2. **Prioritization**: Issues will be prioritized based on severity and potential impact
3. **Remediation**: Security fixes will be developed and tested as quickly as possible
4. **Deployment**: Security updates will be deployed promptly
5. **Disclosure**: After remediation, appropriate disclosure will be made to affected users
